## ⚙️ Configuration

### Change Secret Key (IMPORTANT for Production)

Edit `app.py` line 10:
```python
# ❌ BEFORE
app.secret_key = "your-secret-key-change-this-in-production"

# ✅ AFTER
app.secret_key = "your-unique-random-secret-key-here-make-it-long"
```

### Change Port

Edit the last line of `app.py`:
```python
# Default: port 5000
app.run(debug=True, host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)

# Custom port: 8000
app.run(debug=True, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find 'main.js'" Error
**Solution**: Make sure `main.js` exists in `static/` folder
- If missing, create it based on your original code

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask_login'"
**Solution**: Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Database is locked"
**Solution**: Close other instances of the app
- Only one instance can modify the database at a time

### Can't Login After Registration
**Solution**: 
1. Verify email is exactly the same as registration
2. Check password didn't have typo
3. Restart the app: `python app.py`

### Forgot Password?
**Current Solution**: Delete `chat_history.db` and restart
- ⚠️ This deletes all saved conversations!
- Future: Implement password reset functionality

### Lost Database
**To Reset:**
```bash
# Delete the database
del chat_history.db

# Restart app (it auto-creates new database)
python app.py
```
